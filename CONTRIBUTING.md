# Contributing
**We welcome and greatly appreciate your contribution to this project!**

While contribution guidelines are loosely defined, we recommend to read the following contents to make your contribution process more efficient.

## Getting Started

We use Yarn (and not NPM) to manage dependencies in stable and consistent ways. 

After installing [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install), clone this repository and run the following commands to install all dependencies and run the Gosling.js editor locally:

```sh
yarn
yarn start
```

Then, you can open http://localhost:3000/ in a web browser to test the online editor.

## Editing `gosling.js/embed`

This repo also contains the source code for `gosling.js/embed`, an ES Module intended to be
used in [Observable notebooks](https://observablehq.com). You can start the development server
via:

```sh
yarn start-embed
```

and open a new Observable notebook with a cell containing,

```javascript
embed = {
    const mod = await import("http://localhost:3000/embed/index.ts");
    return mod.embed;
}
```

You are now able to edit the contents of `src/` and the chages should be reflected
in the notebook. You may fork [this notebook](https://observablehq.com/@manzt/gosling-api)
to get started.


## Editing Grammar
You may want to edit the grammar (e.g., rename properties) and test the updated grammar in the Online Editor. The Gosling's grammar is defined using TypeScript in a single file, [/src/core/gosling.schema.ts](/src/core/gosling.schema.ts). You can update this file to edit grammar. However, to test with Online Editor, you need to update [/src/core/gosling.schema.json](/src/core/gosling.schema.json) by running the following command:

```sh
yarn schema
```

This will create the `gosling.schema.json` file based on the `gosling.schema.ts`. The reason for updating the `*.json` file is that the Online Editor only compiles the gosling spec only if the specification is valid depending of the `gosling.schema.json`. Therefore, if you edit the grammar and do not update the `gosling.schema.json` file, the Online Editor will not compile the spec, showing an empty view.

`gosling.schema.json` is updated everytime when you `commit` changes, so you do not have to run `yarn schema` by yourselves before the `commit`.

Since `gosling.schema.json` is used to semi-automatically generate property tables in [Gosling Documentation](http://gosling-lang.org/docs), we highly recommend you to **provide comments** for added/modified grammar properties in `gosling.schema.ts`. These comments will be used to explain properties in the documentation (e.g., [BigWig Data](http://gosling-lang.org/docs/data#bigwig-no-higlass-server)).
When writing the comments:
- Please use block comment (`/** */`) rather than line comment (`//`) when describing a property. 
  Only the block comment before a property will be converted into the description of this property in `gosling.schema.json`.
- Please write the comment in Markdown syntax (e.g., `__Default__`).
- No need to specify a) whether a property is required or b) the acceptable values for a string property. Such information will be generated automatically. 
- Please add `__Default:__ default_value` line at the end to describe the property's default value.

## Commit Messages

We use [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint#what-is-commitlint) to maintain commit messages in a consistent manner and automatically update a [CHANGELOG.md](/CHANGELOG.md) based on the commit messages.

The allowed pattern of commit messages is:

```sh
type(scope?): subject  # scope is optional; multiple scopes are supported (current delimiter options: "/", "\" and ",")
```

where `type` can be either `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `docs`, `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `revert`, `style`, or `test`.

Example commit messages are as follows:

```sh
git commit -m 'fix: correctly position views'
git commit -m 'feat: add a data preview panel in editor'
git commit -m 'docs: add details about commitlint in README.md'
```

## Opening Pull Requests
We use the [commitlint](#commitlint) for the title of PR. So, if the title of PR is not following the commitlint conventions, [Semantic Pull Request](https://github.com/zeke/semantic-pull-requests) will complain about it, disallowing your PR to be merged. When your PR is accepted and merged into the master branch, the title of the PR will be recorded as a single commit message which will then added as a single item in [CHANGELOG.md](/CHANGELOG.md).
